## Credits

This project was initially motivated by [Snowflake](https://github.com/bartonhammond/snowflake), a React Native boilerplate by Barton Hammond. It shares some features and design principles for Pepperoni, but it wasn't the right fit for our needs. At this time Snowflake is more mature, so if you like Pepperoni but didn't agree with something we are doing, you should check it out to see if it's a good fit for your app.
